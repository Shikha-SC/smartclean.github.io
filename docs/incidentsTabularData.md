# Incidents Tabular Data

It is a detailed tabular representation of incidents and open incidents.<br />

It helps to track:<br />
    1. When was the incident reported, description of the incident and by whom was it reported?<br />
    2. Location of the incident reported.<br />
    3. Images and comments related to the incidents.<br />

## Important Notes

**How do open incidents affect the KPIs?**<br />

Open incidents are resolved directly by the FM app. 

- Open incidents will be shown as "Open" in the incident tile if not *Resolved* by someone.
- Open incidents do not contribute towards "Total Time Spent" and "Avg. Response Time" tiles.
- Hypothetically, if a property was using only the FM app to mark the incident as *Resolved*. Then "Avg. Resolution Rate" would always be 100%.
- Open incidents still contribute towards the count. For example: "Total No. Of Workorders", "No. Of Workorders - By Type and Zone", "Incidents by Priority", "Incidents by Status", "Incidents by Resolver", "Incidents by Type" and "Incidents by Zone" have open incidents included in them.
- Open incidents do not contribute towards SLA violations as they were not allocated to anyone.

**What are the incident types?**<br />

There are two types: "Others" and "Sensor". "Sensor" are the ones generated from the sensor.
