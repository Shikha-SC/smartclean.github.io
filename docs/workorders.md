## What is SmartClean Workorders

Workorders allows you to perform the following actions:
- **Create shifts for workforce (_scheduling_)**: Shifts are used to plan the working hours for a person for a day of month. A shift may also span the next day (_night shifts_). Various options can be used to indicate availability of the person to all the zones or a subset of zones. Additionally, pre-defined tasks can be added to the shifts for schedule driven tasks. The shifts can be repeated using multiple options as described further in this documentation.
- **View or report incidents**: Incidents are any issues in the facility that need to be resolved as soon as possible. You can view and create incidents and assign them optionally to a certain member who is in shift for that area.
- **Create or use tasks and task groups for one or more zones**: Tasks and task groups can be used to pre-define the commonly performed set of actions by people so that it can be easily added to the shifts being planned.
