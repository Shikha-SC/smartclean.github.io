# People Usage Metrics

This report helps in visualizing the footfall, distribution of the number of people across zones and weeks. Hence helping to know the popular zones, popular days of the week, and busiest hours of the building.<br />

## Helpful terminologies

**Peak Day of Week**: For the time range for which the report was generated, which day of the week had the most number of people present.<br />
**Peak Hours**: For the time range for which the report was generated, which hour had the most people present consistently.<br />

## Helpful pointers for understanding some graphs:

1. “Popular/busiest hour of the building” helps in understanding for a particular hour in the day on average how many people are present. Also, this helps us to gauge the most popular hours.<br />

    *Example(Graph below)*: For the 11th hour, the number of people present on average is 487. The busiest hours are the 15th and 19th hours when the “average number of people” present are 1082 and 1080 respectively.

2. “Weekly people distribution” graph helps in understanding for a particular hour and day of the week, what is the average footfall? On the x-axis, we have the hours and on the y-axis, we have different days of the week.<br />

    *Example(Graph below)*: For the 8th hour and Tuesday, the average Footfall is 496.
