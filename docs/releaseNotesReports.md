- **Improvements to Task Incidents Summary Report**: Incidents summary report now shows KPIs pertaining to open state incidents also. Previously, open state incidents (that is, those that are not allocated to anyone) were ignored by the system.
- **Incidents tabular report**: Tabular export of incidents in a time range is now possible alongwith associated image links. The same is also available for download as PDF and XLSX format.
- **Scheduled tasks tabular report**: Scheduled tasks performed in a time range can now be presented as a tabular web report along with associated PDF and XLSX downloads.
- **Missing emails for web reports**: A bug causing emails to be not generated on generation of web reports is now fixed.
