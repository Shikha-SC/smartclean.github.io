# Release notes for 2022-03-21

Feature
{: .label .label-blue }
- **Matrix** has two new features. 

1. **Matrix Command Centre**: Now, you get live updates on-screen without bouncing through different modules. It gives you birds-eye visibility with KPIs from the modules in a single place. Customise it at any time to fit the requirements. You can co-label or white label the platform for better personalisation.

2. **Configure availability in Matrix**: Admins can now indicate employees' availability via *Matrix* (web and mobile app). It is then displayed in the schedule, enabling the planner to consider it while assigning shifts and tasks. Availability is a kind of ad-hoc shift without any impact of delayed shift & absent shift. It is for properties with higher prioritisation for workorder resolution irrespective of workforce attendance. It removes the burden of creating zones and scheduling tasks.

    To start, the person with valid access should configure the shift hours and shift day mapping available under the settings tab of the workforce module.  
    a. *Shift Day Mapping*: It defines the scope of a shift with its duration, starts and ends time, and the required workforce. This scoping may vary from day to day, and *Matrix* allows you to configure it individually.  
    b. *Shift hours*: The working duration of facility management services based on the property's working hours. 

    The cleaner can clock in through their HK app. He then completes all work getting allocated to them during the availability hours.

- **Housekeeping app** has two new features. 

1. The *HouseKeeping app* now allows all clocked-in users to start scheduled tasks if its available under the open tasks tab. Previously, the cleaners were allowed to work on assigned tasks only.  

2. Any user with *HouseKeeping app* can report an incident via the app. Auto allocation does not work here. The manager can verify the issue and assign to available workforce through web or FM app.
