# Indoor air quality monitoring
SmartClean's air quality measurement sensor is a battery operated sensor that measures the following environmental parameters:

- **Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), Temperature, Humidity**: The IAQ index, temperature and relative humidity is derived from the measurements by *Bosch BME680* module.
A detailed note on its functionality and measurement parameters can be found [here](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme680-ds001.pdf) and [here](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/application_notes_1/bst-bme680-an014.pdf).

- **Ammonia (ppb)**: This metric is measured using an electrochemical sensing module from *Semiatech*. Values are measured in units of parts per billion.
The datasheet can be found [here](https://www.smartclean.io/matrix/pdfs/WCAirQualitySensor_ENv4.pdf).
